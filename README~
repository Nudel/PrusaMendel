RepRap.no Basic Prusa Mendel

This is a fork of gregfrost fork of Prusa Mendel. It'll be a basic getting-started metric lm8uu Prusa Mendel with upgrades we like, and we will print, document and support this design for the norwegian community.

The files needed for the printer is located in the /stl folder.
Extra upgrades or alternative parts are located in /stlextra.
Source files (where available) are in the root directory.
No thingdoc setup as of yet, but we hope to add that at some point.

-Nudel, RoTorIT and more.
